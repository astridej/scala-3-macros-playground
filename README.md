# Scala 3 Macro playground

Code supporting the talk on macros in Scala 3 I gave at the Mobimeo Scala Chapter Day.

Tagline: with great power comes great responsibility. This repository demonstrates things that are
theoretically possible with macros, including ones that are bad ideas. (In other words, please do not 
_actually_ write code that won't compile if it's raining.)
